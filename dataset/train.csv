However there is one occassion when I was paralyzed with fear.   
This was when I was doing my M.A.-I, and we had a series of student  
lectures.  I was one of the participants and my lecture happened  
to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about  
twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing  
me.  I felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and I was really  
paralyzed.  This incident of fear is still fresh."

It happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in

class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got  
into my element and started imitating the professor, and the  
professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was  
unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but  
it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I  
suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her  
entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw  
what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through   
out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the  
fact that she gave me a character certificate. "
1,"This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus,  
by a stranger.  He would follow me to the campus and then sit  
outside my class.  If I was not there he would ask my friends as  
to where I was.  He was a dark, ominous looking person and I was

staying over at another girls placce.  One of them started  
passing very nasty and outright bitchy remarks at me.  It was  
brought on by a male colleague's compliments to me, this girl was  
herself interested in this guy.  Bitchiness and catty remarks  
made by women never fail to disgust me.  I can particularly

guy."

enthusiasm in local affairs.  I did not understand why they had  
decided to work as community leaders."

fellowship.  That day I had been preparing for the exams and did  
not estimate the time to travel to the church right and I was  
twenty minutes late.  As I had not prepared well I led the  
meeting badly.  I was ashamed of myself.  "

told me not to go.  Unfortunately I broke my pectoral girdle and  
had to go to hospital.  When my mother  came to see me I felt  
guilty as I had not listened to her and I had to soon sit for a  
public examination."
1,"At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my  
mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and  
that her husband should go and see her.  I could not believe this

boxes.  However I immediately ran to the scene of the accident."
2,"The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I  
should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of   
her prejudice and misunderstanding, started a  quarrel with my  
mother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately

should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new  
house that day."

research group of the Chinese university student union.  I knew  
a lot of CV students there.  A year later one of them was  
travelling in mainland China and he got T.B.  He died a few weeks  
after coming back to H.K.  We all got together for the funeral  
and when I looked at the body for the last time I felt extremely  
sad."
4,"During these Summer vacations a schoolmate who was not in my  
class went to Britain.  Before he left, his classmates and some  
of us who were accquainted with him had a B.B.Q on the beach.   
When I arrived I saw that some people , who were not close  
friends of the departing person(person A), were playing mahjong.   
Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides  
it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk  
and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.   
They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they  
talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and   
another classmate."
6,"I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me  
and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual  
life than I was.  When I was with my brothers and sisters of  
Christ I had a guilty feeling which could not be dismissed  
easily.  When pepole asked me as to when I would be baptised my  
guilt feeling deepened."

houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have  
much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen  
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on  
which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the  
short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the  
plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat  
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."
3,"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good  
friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them  
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind  
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made  
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was  
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
4,"I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like  
him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help  
rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away  
from him as soon as possible."

for two months.  Yesterday I was chatting with my teacher and  
when we talked of the Summer job, I felt ashamed."

outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would  
question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and  
did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet  
him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very  
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble."

parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I   
had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children   
may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and   
this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was   
still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen   
to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house."
0,"That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the  
higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very

diligence had paid and I was very happy."

antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very  
frightened."
2,"Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very  
uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him  
furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence  
because of traditional moral values.  "
3,"My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it  
was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I

expect too much from going to the university."
6,"At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key.   
During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and  
talking secretly.  I do not know why I suspected them, also  
another classmate supported me.  He remembers that these people  
had only one key in the key-ring, this had seemed strange to him.  
 Besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling  
books at a book-shop and they should not have had such books.  I  
told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the  
books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not  
helped him as he stole later on also.  I felt guilty"

several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend

smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen  
me.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry."

subject if I were to change it."

not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.  "
2,"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt  
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did  
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other  
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant  
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that  
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not  
say anything but just watched me leave."
3,"Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before  
the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I  
got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all

"
1,"It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I  
had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that  
I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld  
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period  
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice  
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable  
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright  
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my  
brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue  
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."

grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This  
made me angry."

and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives  
and my tears made me sad."
6,"At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid  
doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch  
together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had  
promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime  
after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize  
his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a  
university student and ought to have self-respect.  He  
disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him  
and did not want to keep any contact with him."
5,"My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were  
his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.

felt ashamed at having misunderstood him."
0,"In August,1983, the long awaited ""big envelope"" (a document for  
C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had  
not been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag,  
knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly  
opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe.  
 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
1,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was  
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very  
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of  
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to  
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results  
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a  
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
2,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not  
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation  
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt  
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost  
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower  
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not  
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
5,"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was  
working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had  
joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female  
classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not  
fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I  
realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I  
said sorry to her and the matter came to an end."

5,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her  
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in  
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me  
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.   
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be  
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university   
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they  
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five  
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another  
child to teach."
5,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had  
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After  
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and

would think that I had not prepared for it."

was scolded immediately."
