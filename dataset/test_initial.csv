NOW I would not have done it."

7191,fear,"Tutorial again !  A fearful feeling came to me when I sat on the  
chair and looked at my fellow students all around.  I was really  
scared that they would ask me some questions or challenge the  
ideas that I had presented."
7193,sadness,"A and I were walking along the new Asia stairway to the Chung Chi  
college for our lecture and I saw him with her.  He put one arm  
around her shoulder and laugher brightly and joyfully.  I did not  
dare and did not want to look, just walked by them quickly.  The  
interest of talking to A disappeared and I just wanted to remain  
silent.  But I did not want A to know and so I left him and went  
to F.  I should have expected this to happen."
7194,disgust,"Knowing that I had to do the survey with him I felt very  
reluctant.  Although I do not know him I feel disgusted by just  
looking at him.  Thinking that the project lasted several days I  
regreted having joined that project."
7195,shame,"During the lesson the teacher called me and asked me if I had  
reported that I was late.  I pretended that I had but looking at  
her eyes I knew that she knew that I was lying.  I thought that  
it was really bad luck that she had examined the list of the  
students who were late."
7196,guilt,"That evening when I opened the songbook while I was singing the  
song ""Those were the days"" that guilt feeling became stronger.   
The lyrics described well - I was really wrong.  The wish that I

happy and we would play happily together like the days in  
secondary school and she would not be disappointed and gloomy  
because of me."

instrument.  One Saturday morning my mother asked me to go with

instructors would have a meeting the advisor would be present.   
He did not understand our worknig conditions but talked a lot  
and had a lot of outdated ideas.  Whenever we disagreed with him  
he was very discontent and said that we had a prejudice against  
him.  Why did he have to treat us as his subordinates ?"
7237,shame,"When we received  our academic result I learnt that my  results

accquaintances were good and when they asked me about my results  
I really did not want to answer."

questions and expressed her opinions.  She, very often, took a  
stand which was different from mine and she thought that it  
was better than mine.  Her opinions were helpful academically, but

she seemed to be very talkative and so she disgusted me."

guilt as I had not kept my promise."

to read and my teacher did not accept my work as it was handed in  
late."
7284,disgust,When I was studying and someone disturbed me.
7287,joy,"I realized that a fellow member had grown spiritually.  I was the  
leader of a spiritual group and had prayed for him.  He did not

brought along a lamp which was not working very well.  The door  
made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were  
happening.  The most terrifying bit was that there were many  
wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of  
the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me.   The  
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."
7338,anger,"During a football match, the other team was rude and they hurt my

punished us unreasonably.  Later we fought with each other and  
the match had to be cut short."
7341,shame,"In a Christian gathering's lucky draw I mistook a girl's name for  
mine (a boy's name).  I realized my mistake only when I went up  
to the stage for the prize.  I did not know what to do as  
everyone was looking at me.  I blushed and went back to my seat."
7344,fear,"When I went home and there was nobody, I waited till 2 A.M and       
still nobody.  I was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never  
happened before.  In addition my mother was very weak and I  
feared that she had met with an accident.  Therefore I was anxious   
all night."
7345,anger,"Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had

so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin."

at once.  "
7351,fear,"Whenever I am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street,

partly visible.  This emotion was very strong when as an 8 year    
old child I saw something horrible.  "
7353,sadness,"There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of  
mine.  He only thought about his own interest and not about our  
friendship.  This behaviour hurt his friends.  Another incident  
is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons."
7355,shame,"When I was emotionally unstable I said things which may have hurt  
others or made them feel unhappy.  When I calmed down I realized  
that I had been selfish and had not taken into consideration the  
feelings of others.  Then I felt ashamed as someone pointed out my  
behaviour to me."

us as to who had heard the fairy tale - I was the only one who  
put up his hand and this surprised the whole class."
7370,guilt,"We always made a lot of noise during a certain lecture.  This may  
have been because we did not respect the lecturer. Finaly, the  
lecturer could not tolerate it and he scolded us angrily and  
pointed out our misbehaviour."
7372,fear,"During the first year in university I had bad results in both  
the terms, especially the first term.  I was afraid that  I would

G.P.A was very low."
7378,joy,"One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had  
been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the  
soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having  
lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to  
why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me  
before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would  
look very nice if we wore them together."
7379,fear,"The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I  
had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare

not be able to finish it."
7388,sadness,"When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed  
with my brother.  My parents slept on the lower deck.  My father  
felt disgusted and beat me up.  I felt very sad as my father had  
never beaten me or scolded me before."
7389,disgust,"My boyfriend and I did not have any contact with each other during   
the Summer holidays.  I met him the day of the registration and looked

I said no as I did not want him to do me a favour."
7393,fear,"I was on a trip to Phillipines during Summer and I was staying in  
a hotel.  The room I was staying in was very silent and had very  
dim lights.  The last night I felt frightened and lay awake - I  
could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes - I  
waited for dawn."
7394,anger,"I had a very good friend in secondary school.  The year after our  
graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off  
all my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we

disappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I  
didcovered thay she was busy, I did not call her anymore."

7424,guilt,"I borrowed my classmate's notebook one week before the  
examination and I promised to give it back to her in two days  
time.  I was very busy at that time and forgot many things; as I  
was not very often at home she could not contact me.  When I  
started my revision I realized that her notebook had been on my  
desk for five days.  I contacted her immediately and gave it back  
to her.  Though she did not say anything I felt very guilty."
7425,joy,"When high level results were declared, I found my candidature  
number.  I was very happy as I had not expected it.  As I had been   
injured before the examination and I had performed poorly."
7427,anger,"When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen.  
It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I  
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to  
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always  
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I  
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil  
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a  
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with  
them."
7428,sadness,"I quarrelled with my younger sister because I had said something  
against her boyfriend.  Consequently she looked through me when  
she saw me as she thought that I was trying to separate them.   
She had misunderstood me."

we (6 of us) waited for the members of the band to greet us in  
front of the stage.  We went out after a few minutes as it was  
time to close the hall.  We had been waiting at the entrance hall  
for ten minutes when three of the band members came out.  They  
were very excited to see us, one of them was so excited that he  
had tears in his eyes.  We felt very warm and close to each  
other.  They took us back into the hall and we talked freely.  We  
were together for about an hour and during this time we felt  
that they were very sincere."
7437,shame,"When I was in lower six I joined an interview group to  
interview the general public.  One of my friends in the group  
lost her purse and she was very nervous.  Five of us had to go  
another place so we left her, and planned to see her later.  Then  
I heard her describing how her purse looked.  I realized that I  
had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any  
thing about it. "

court.   However when I arrived at the university gym the clerk  
told me that the court was being used for lessons."
7443,disgust,"A few days back I was waiting for the bus at the bus stop.   
Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of  
coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put  
these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I  
thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the  
bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins  
were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying  
and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not  
understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me  
feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just  
to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few  
coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first  
time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him  
scolding me and I felt disgusted."
7444,shame,"A few days back I had a tutorial class and the teacher randomly

present and I could not keep calm, was confused and result was  
very poor.  I really felt ashamed."
7447,fear,"After seeing a horror film - Omen.  I could not sleep at night   
even though I closed my eyes.  The last scene of the film kept  
coming back to me, I seemed to hear the girls in the film  
shouting at the devil.  The devil did not have any expression on  
his face and I thought that he would choose me."
7448,anger,"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that  
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's  
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I  
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so  
he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is  
I was in a bad mood then)."
7452,guilt,"I wanted to get rid of a bad habit and it seemed that I had  
succeeded.  However a year later I got the bad habit again.  I felt   
useless as I always found excuses to explain my behaviour.  As a result I  
felt guilty."
7453,joy,"During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close    
friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my  
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had  
been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the  
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was  
really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all  
day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the  
good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my  
studies.  
"
7455,anger,"We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the

and then left."

time I felt disgusted and thought that it was a nonsense thing."
7458,shame,"One rainy day when the streets were wet, and as I was walking down  
a slope, I fell down out of my carelessness.  There were many

ankle and it was painful."
7464,disgust,"My friend and I worked for the community centre by holding a booth.  
 One day my friend went off to another booth to play.  This

behaviour disgusted me."
7465,shame,"When I was in a bus on my way to the examination centre, a man     
sitting opposite me kept looking at me continously.  I did not know   
what was wrong.  When I reached the  centre I started strolling around   
as I still had a little time.  Suddenly a man came and whispered ""You   
have forgotten to zip up your trousers.""  I was at a loss to say anything   
and I felt very embarrassed.  When I thought of the bus incident I felt   
even more ashamed."

the presence of my friends by giving me a present."

me to study by myself first but I did not do it.  When he asked me  
 if I had studied, I felt very ashamed. "
7473,guilt,"I escaped from communicating with God for a long time.  I did not  
read the scriptures and I did not pray.  I felt that I was  
getting further and further away from God.  I felt guilty as this  
was because of my laziness."
7474,joy,"When two female classmates and I were having lunch, we chatted and   
cracked jokes, I was very happy.  However, I felt that I may have   
said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad   
impression of me."

balls.  I found one near the tennis court and took it to be mine

opened my book to read.  In my heart I wanted to give them the  
seat."
7501,guilt,"In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging  
person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time  
to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care  
of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my  
own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty."
7505,fear,"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September  
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in  
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not  
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about  
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.   
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
7506,anger,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had  
melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played  
the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell  
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right  
to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to  
leave the room and go somewhere else."
7508,shame,I lied to one of my best friends.
7515,fear,"I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when  
I called out loudly."
