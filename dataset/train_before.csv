hurt his head.  The other one used this to spank the head of the 
boy on the ground."

she was angry and disappointed."

years)."

be able to be with me."

or a snake. But I mean it in a social aspect when somebody had

them."

guilt,"I felt guilty at being part of the successful people. Felt guilty  
at being a student when other people were not. Guilt about being  
a potential success in various areas of society. (So stupid this  
emotion)"
fear,"A Maori language oral test, yeaterday - Although I had studied  
intensely - once in the examiners room ""I blew it"" -  I was so  
nervous I couldn't reply easily - It was very important, but I  
got only blankness."
anger,"A friend visited and made comments that my house/garden were not  
as neat/tidy as in the past. I'd not seen her a year - She  
implied I'd gone to the pack (I'd only been working full time,  
and taking 3 University exams part time)."
sadness,"When my father a 4th/5th generation colonial (from Eng.) attacked  
me verbally about my chosen partner. A man whom he discarded  
because his colour skin was not white. His ultimate disgust  
saddned me."
disgust,"People who came to our home - and requested ""Put out your smoke"".  
That we should not smoke in our house... and asked not even  
politely. It disgusted me because I think people need to adapt to  
the situation."
shame,"Put down by my father - at a family outing at mutual family  
friends dinner. Told ""Not to Speak"". The attitude by him was  
negative/I was in mid 20s, I had done many things - a wide range  
of experiences. Probably greater than he."
guilt,"Not attending school, when  am not sick - but in need of mental  
rest. Staff on your return query your ""sickness"" - it is easier  
in N.Z. to be sick, rather than confide other personal reasons  
etc."

guilt,"When I made an excuse to get out of participating in an important  
family occasion that I should not have missed."
joy,"Being reunited with my family after not having seen them for 5  
years, at the airport. Sheer elation at getting through the  
""paper work"" collecting bags and the anticipation of coming  
through the customs gate."
fear,"I caught a huge eel on a fishing line which I had pulled into the  
boat. I cut the line and threw the whole lot back into the water.  
Later that day and about ten miles away I went swimming and  
someone made the comment wondering how far eels could swim, I  
abruptly ended swimming for fear at an unseen eel for a few days  
until we had left the district."
anger,"This situation keeps occurring - when my little sister disagrees  
with me or vice-versa. We have very similar temperaments and I  
always end up feeling angry at her and myself for fighting so  
much over unimportant trivial matters."
sadness,"When my grandmother, who has been living with us for 14 years,  
had a stroke and was left paralysed on one side. She has been  
quite close to our family and to see her suffer in this way makes  
me feel really sad."
disgust,"A gathering of a social sports club at which they proceeded to  
show pornographic videos and then afterwards (when most people  
had had quite a bit to drink) carried on in a very degrading,  
unmoral manner - especially females exposing and flaunting  
themselves with no shame or embarassment."
guilt,"This feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. I  
(being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in  
and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend. Many months  
later, when I was doing some deeper self analysis I began to feel  
guilty and realized that I had gone against what I wanted for  
myself and my future."

my family - forever."

is quite happy for him to play around - as well as herself."
shame,NO RESPONSE.
guilt,"I did not attend a social studies observation class for 1 whole  
week (I am a student trainee teacher). Anyway the other teachers  
thought this was okay because the teacher I was supposed to  
observe was not well liked. The teacher was in fact really nice  
to me - but I wanted to get out of teaching a hard topic he had  
given me."
joy,"Passing my pharmacy exams which meant my tertiary education for  
pharmacy completed."

because he thought I could dance with my friends who were

relationship due to some circumstances between her and her  
family. I was really sad, hurt and couldn't really find any  
reason why am I still living. Is this life is all about ? This  
was one of few question which crept up vividly every time I  
thought about what had happened."
disgust,"I'm very disgusted when I see people abusing their body with

over-protecting and selfish attitudes."
shame,When ditched - divorced by husband.
guilt,"When I had to lie about my age to be accepted as a member of a  
group."
joy,"My cousin asked me to be a bridesmaid for her. This made really  
happy because I was adopted into the family and her asking me  
made me realise that she saw me as a cousin and not just another  
person. There were other cousins she could have asked but she  
asked me."
anger,"(1) My father died. (2) My natural father contacted me a year  
after my father died and this angered me more as I thought he

joy,"When my lover and I felt like we had gone full circle. And our  
relationship was new, fresh, vital etc. once again."
fear,"My daughter was 2 yrs she went up to a colt tried to hit it. It  
turned on her and kicked her over the heart, sent her flying  
through the air. I left my mother and sister to deal to her as  
they are nurses. I felt I didn't want to know if she was going to  
die, it was just too much."

from the pews (I am in the choir) and shook my hand during the  
time for an informal ""greeting"" in the church service. She said a  
few words."
fear,"I walked up the main street of Auckland at 10 o'clock at night. I

thought it was actually quite quiet, though also oppressive. I  
walked about half a mile and bought a drink along the way."

disgust,"Having moved into a flat within the last week I felt some disgust  
that a bathroom tap had been left to drip with a faulty fawcet."

things went and his suggestion that I could ring and doing that it  
was really good - though really insane conversation."

of my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry, told him to  
get out. He was surprised, hesitated; I started to move towards  
him and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to  
go. Because I'd got the initiative, I succeeded. A very powerful  
message."
sadness,"When my grandmother died - I wasn't sad so much that she'd died  
because she was old, but because she lived in the last few years  
in an old people's home and had nothing very much that was hers -  
no chair, or private space, and when I went to visit she would be  
sitting in the ""lliving"" room the TV room. It was hopeless. And I  
felt awkward so I didn't go and I was sad 'cos how I couldn't."

pushbike as a little boy - all alone, lost and surrounded by

my financial, physical, spiritual and emotional needs will be  
well catered for. This position fulfils a lot of my aims for the  
last five years of my life."

unwillingness to challenge him about these attitudes in order to

siblings, been under pressure at school and wasn't going to the  
party I wanted to go - instead I was going out with my family. A  
guy called and said, in effect, that I was ""nice"" and he liked  
me. Hence the emotional joy."

in a verbal battle I couldn't seem to get through to her to  
really hurt her."

partly I think, due to the fact that I couldn't/didn't cry."

whom were younger than her. On one occasion my brother did  
something my sister didn't like. A full-scale battle began."

young and pretty naive and he was pretty crude and real, sort of,  
macho. It was dark, at night during the summer and we were  
talking."
guilt,"I was using my sister's stereo while everyone was out. I know she  
wouldn't want me to and I would get into trouble if she found

family."

whom I loved and who was not in any way responsible for what had  
happened (my sister)."
joy,Easter holiday - I had been working weekends and had just left.
fear,Haven't been frightened for ages.

and the school. Sadness was intermingled with the other feelings."

not being genuinely happy for her in the first place."

by ourselves. One night we were nearly raped by about 20 locals -  
they came to our bach and tried to break the doors down. All of

is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results.   
However there is one occassion when I was paralyzed with fear.   
This was when I was doing my M.A.-I, and we had a series of student  
lectures.  I was one of the participants and my lecture happened  
to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about  
twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing  
me.  I felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and I was really  
paralyzed.  This incident of fear is still fresh."
anger,"I experience this emotion quite often but the day I was most  
angry was the day I got pulled up for something I had not done.   
It happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in  
class but the monitor had written my name on the board.  So I  
had a remark in my callender which I had to get signed by my  
parents.  This remark resulted in me being spanked."
disgust,"This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life  
in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three  
men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were  
beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets  
and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to  
myself -""what is life?"".  It is one hell of a place where  
everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of  
the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about  
such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and  
dejected."
shame,"This is an event I will never forget.  I am considered a good  
mimic.  This particular day we were waiting for a professor  
to take her class.  This  professor had a peculiar accent and a  
very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this  
class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got  
into my element and started imitating the professor, and the  
professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was  
unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but  
it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I  
suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her  
entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw  
what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through   
out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the  
fact that she gave me a character certificate. "
fear,"This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus,  
by a stranger.  He would follow me to the campus and then sit  
outside my class.  If I was not there he would ask my friends as  
to where I was.  He was a dark, ominous looking person and I was  
terrified of him as I did not know his intentions.  I reported  
him to the security officer, who turned him over to the police.   
I was even more petrified then."
sadness,"The day I was to receive my gold-medal for the M.A, my  
grandmother, who I loved very much, died after an illness.  She

for, but did not get to see. "
disgust,"We had come back from a programme and we were all (three girls)     
staying over at another girls placce.  One of them started  
passing very nasty and outright bitchy remarks at me.  It was  
brought on by a male colleague's compliments to me, this girl was  
herself interested in this guy.  Bitchiness and catty remarks  
made by women never fail to disgust me.  I can particularly

guy."

against him, in the meanwhile people intervened."

with them outside and to catch some boys.  However our parents  
did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very  
late and I feared being scolded by my parents."
anger,"When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to  
another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and  
attitudes.  I was very angry."
sadness,"About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate.   
This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would  
say such things.  The reason she gave me was that we were not  
suited for each other."
disgust,"Once while studying for my exam I found so many complicated words  
that it disgusted me."
joy,"[ During a certain period, I felt successful and extremely satisfied.    
When I found that any tasks or decisions that I had made were better   
than expected.]"
fear,I am scared when I stroll alone on the Chung Chi college campus. 
anger,"One day, I discussed a very important question with A.  A  
suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and  
thought that he himself was right.  Moreover, he attacked   
strongly, not my opinion but me personally."
sadness,"When I learnt that I had failed an exam,  This not only influenced  
my emotions but also other important tasks, it also made my  
record imperfect."
disgust,"[ I would classify subjectively, a certain gesture or the way of  
talking of a person as disgusting or inacceptable.]"
joy,"I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had  
been admitted to the university."
anger,Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
sadness,"A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within  
two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not  
bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried  
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two  
years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as  
cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in  
suffernig , even die instead of her."
disgust,"I used to play with a group of classmates and I found out later  
that they were cheap in thought, behaviour and conduct - they  
would smoke, fight and speak foul language.  I thought that they  
destroyed the image of college students."
guilt,"Many years back I quarrelled with my younger brother for a small  
reason.  I used a pole to beat him and nearly broke his arm.  He  
recovered after a treatment which lasted several months.  After  
this our relationship was worse and he would not listen to me."
anger,"A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for  
the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and  
the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an  
hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then."
sadness,"After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would  
have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and  
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would  
understand this as they had always done).  They did not  
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many  
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."
disgust,"When I was studying in the library a pair of lovers were sitting  
next to me talking in an intense and soft voice.  They were  
disturbing others."
shame,"During an informal discussion I contributed a lot even though I  
had not spent much time studying.  Whenever someone said that  
someone was not paying attention, or that he had too many other  
things to do, or that the persoon was not trying his best, I  
would feel ashamed."
guilt,"Our class had organized a picnic in November.  I was the class  
representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic  
was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then.  
Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for  
the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that  
my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as  
I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class  
representative that I was not going but he did not know the  
reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked  
me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone  
mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in  
the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me  
as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind  
afterwards."
joy,"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was  
during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while  
handing in our homework.  He invited me have a trip with him and  
we were together till 8 P.M."
fear,"The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to  
school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I  
reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the  
fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would  
die."
anger,"One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back  
in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and  
wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him  
but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very  
angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly  
and freely."
shame,"On Christmas eve I went to a classmate's home with other  
classmates.  The next morning when I came out of the toilet she

to zip them up.  I rushed back to the toilet but by the time the  
others had guessed what had happened."

water on his head."

We were in a flurry but at that time I felt the love and concern  
of my friends."

seems that I am deceiving myself but I cannot find the way out."

and talked to me for half an hour or more.  However there was  
nothing important in the conversation and I found the person very  
disgusting."
shame,I felt shame when I found that I was almost last in the exam.
guilt,"Once I bought my sister a pair of sports shoes as she was going  
to join an athletic meet.  However the shoes were a little big  
and had a few flaws.  She muttered all the way and blamed me for  
having wasted her money anf I felt guilty."

One day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my  
mother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and  
even threatened her with a pair of scissors.  "

when I was talking to her, her boyfriend appeared and I felt  
ashamed."

the results were announced I looked in the newspaper and saw my  
candidature number."

not know."

I tried my best."
anger,"I had a date with my girlfriend, the time and place had not been  
fixed.  I asked her to phone me an hour later as it was midnight

my fellow mates."

he tried to flatter other people and did not respect me."
shame,My guilty behaviour was found out by others.
joy,"During my Summer vacations I planned a carnival for the community  
youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the  
organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this  
period we got to know and understood each other.  We  
discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting  
things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was  
bright, the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.   
I felt extremely excited about it."
anger,"I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told  
others that I would take down the names of the people who  
misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.   
Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others.  
 I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he  
picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious  
enough to be blamed."
disgust,"I had joined a youth group that observed the affairs of our  
community and so I had many opportunities to contact the  
government and the committee members of the district board (a  
local executive structure).  We always tried to consult and  
discuss with them, but we found that such people did not  
understand community affairs and they even dampened our  
enthusiasm in local affairs.  I did not understand why they had  
decided to work as community leaders."
shame,"One day I was the leader of the weekly meeting of the Church  
fellowship.  That day I had been preparing for the exams and did  
not estimate the time to travel to the church right and I was  
twenty minutes late.  As I had not prepared well I led the  
meeting badly.  I was ashamed of myself.  "

days after doing it the teacher asked us to do it again at a meeting   
and I forgot my part."
guilt,"Once, my friend and I went to the Tai 60 to cycle.  My mother had  
told me not to go.  Unfortunately I broke my pectoral girdle and  
had to go to hospital.  When my mother  came to see me I felt  
guilty as I had not listened to her and I had to soon sit for a  
public examination."
fear,"At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my  
mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and  
that her husband should go and see her.  I could not believe this

boxes.  However I immediately ran to the scene of the accident."
anger,"The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I  
should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of   
her prejudice and misunderstanding, started a  quarrel with my  
mother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately

should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new  
house that day."

research group of the Chinese university student union.  I knew  
a lot of CV students there.  A year later one of them was  
travelling in mainland China and he got T.B.  He died a few weeks  
after coming back to H.K.  We all got together for the funeral  
and when I looked at the body for the last time I felt extremely  
sad."
disgust,"During these Summer vacations a schoolmate who was not in my  
class went to Britain.  Before he left, his classmates and some  
of us who were accquainted with him had a B.B.Q on the beach.   
When I arrived I saw that some people , who were not close  
friends of the departing person(person A), were playing mahjong.   
Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides  
it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk  
and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.   
They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they  
talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and   
another classmate."
guilt,"I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me  
and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual  
life than I was.  When I was with my brothers and sisters of  
Christ I had a guilty feeling which could not be dismissed  
easily.  When pepole asked me as to when I would be baptised my  
guilt feeling deepened."

possibility of being accepted into the university, I felt very

messed up her belongings."
joy,"I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone  
houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have  
much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen  
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on  
which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the  
short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the  
plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat  
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."
sadness,"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good  
friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them  
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind  
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made  
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was  
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
disgust,"I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like  
him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help  
rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away  
from him as soon as possible."

for two months.  Yesterday I was chatting with my teacher and  
when we talked of the Summer job, I felt ashamed."
fear,"A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes  
outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would  
question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and  
did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet  
him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very  
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble."
guilt,"One night during dinner my nephew was naughty, so I quarrelled with my   
parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I   
had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children   
may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and   
this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was   
still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen   
to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house."
joy,"That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the  
higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very  
carefully and found that my results were much better than I  
had expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My  
diligence had paid and I was very happy."
fear,"When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the  
antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very  
frightened."
anger,"Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very  
uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him  
furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence  
because of traditional moral values.  "
sadness,"My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it  
was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I  
getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not  
expect too much from going to the university."
guilt,"At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key.   
During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and  
talking secretly.  I do not know why I suspected them, also  
another classmate supported me.  He remembers that these people  
had only one key in the key-ring, this had seemed strange to him.  
 Besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling  
books at a book-shop and they should not have had such books.  I  
told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the  
books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not  
helped him as he stole later on also.  I felt guilty"
anger,"I came across a girl at the school bus-stop, I had seen her  
several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend  
had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I  
smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen  
me.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry."

tried my best.  Then I started wondering about my abilities for  
the major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major  
subject if I were to change it."
disgust,"When my roommate and I had dinner together we decided as to who  
would clean the bowls.  One day when I came back from school I  
found that she had not cleaned up.  Since I had to cook dinner I  
cleaned them myself and felt unhappy and disgusted."
fear,"I did not do well in one of the subjects last term.   I was  
afraid that I would fail.  My result was a grade D, though it was  
not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.  "
anger,"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt  
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did  
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other  
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant  
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that  
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not  
say anything but just watched me leave."
sadness,"Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before  
the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I  
got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all       
good I felt a little sad."
disgust,"Whenever I spoke to a female classmate I felt disgusted.  She  
said meaningless things and seemed to indicate something to me  
but I did not love/like her."

them."

sadness,"One night my father suddenly suffered from a heart attack which  
lead to breathing difficulties."

get together at that time) someone knocked vigorously on the

  She wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend.  The content of  
the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy. 
"
fear,"It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I  
had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that  
I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld  
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period  
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice  
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable  
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright  
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my  
brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue  
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."
anger,"The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often  
grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This  
made me angry."
sadness,"When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then  
and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives  
and my tears made me sad."
guilt,"At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid  
doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch  
together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had  
promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime  
after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize  
his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a  
university student and ought to have self-respect.  He  
disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him  
and did not want to keep any contact with him."
shame,"My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were  
his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.   
Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I  
felt ashamed at having misunderstood him."
joy,"In August,1983, the long awaited ""big envelope"" (a document for  
C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had  
not been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag,  
knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly  
opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe.  
 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was  
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very  
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of  
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to  
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results  
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a  
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not  
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation  
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt  
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost  
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower  
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not  
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
shame,"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was  
working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had  
joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female  
classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not  
fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I  
realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I  
said sorry to her and the matter came to an end."
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a  
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I  
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door."
shame,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her  
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in  
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me  
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.   
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be  
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university   
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they  
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five  
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another  
child to teach."
shame,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had  
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After  
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and  
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others  
would think that I had not prepared for it."
fear,"I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the  
door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit  
and bring the germs in the house."

was scolded immediately."
